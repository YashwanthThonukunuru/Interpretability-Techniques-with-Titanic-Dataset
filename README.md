# Exploring Interpretability Techniques with Titanic Dataset

## Overview

Welcome to the "Exploring Interpretability Techniques" project. This repository contains the implementation of an interpretability techniques which includes exploring and comparing different techniques applied to the Titanic dataset. 

## Approach

For this assignment, I selected Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explainations (LIME), Anchors and Counterfactual explaianations techniques. These techniques are used to gain insights into their relative strengths and weaknesses.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this assignment was the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including their demographics and survival status..

## Results and Conclusion

Discussed the strengths and limitations of above mentioned techniques, highlighting their suitability for different scenarios. The main output of this project is a Jupyter notebook file, where I documented the entire process of implementing and evaluating the chosen interpretability technique andon the Titanic dataset. The notebook includes code snippets, visualizations, explanations, and insights gained from the analysis.
